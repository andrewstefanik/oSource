        <p>
            With oSource our goal is to simplify this process.  Using oSource allows every user
            to search GitHub's repos for open-source projects that they may want to contribute to.  Utilizing GitHub to
            list your own repos allows the user to add a repo that they may want help with to the oSource's searchable database.
            Once added to our database, a user can add information to the repo allowing others to find it by keywords, skill level, and languages.</p>
