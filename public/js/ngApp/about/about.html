<h3> About </h3>

<p> We at oSource faced what we think is a common problem as Junior Developers. We were told it looks good to ontribute to open source projects, but were not quite sure how to do that, or how to find projects for us to contribute to. This is how the idea of oSource came about. We aimed to create a place where people of all skill levels could not only find open-source projects to work on, but also find help with their own open-source projects.
